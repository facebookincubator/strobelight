# Strobelight

![Strobelight Logo](images/Strobelight_brandmark_full-color-black-text.svg)
Strobelight is a fleetwide profiler framework developed by Meta, designed to provide comprehensive profiling capabilities across large-scale infrastructure. This framework helps in identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing resource utilization across a fleet of machines.

Strobelight is composed of a number of profilers, each profiler collects a certain type of profile. This can include CPU, GPU, Memory, or other types of profiles.

## gpuevent profiler
The `gpuevent` profiler attaches to `cudaLaunchKernel` events and collects information about kernels being launched, including demangled name, arguments, stacks, dimensions, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Linux-based system.
- Gpu host with [NVIDIA CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)
- Cuda binary for testing
- cmake

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/strobelight.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and follow the build instructions:
   ```bash
    cd strobelight
    ./scripts/build.sh -u
   ```

### Usage

Once build is done, you can run the generated binary on any cuda pid
   ```bash
   $ strobelight/src/_build/profilers/gpuevent_snoop --help
Usage: gpuevent_snoop [OPTION...]
GpuEventSnoop.

Traces GPU kernel function execution and its input parameters

USAGE: ./gpuevent_snoop -p PID [-v] [-d duration_sec]

  -a, --args                   Collect Kernel Launch Arguments
  -d, --duration=SEC           Trace for given number of seconds
  -p, --pid=PID                Trace process with given PID
  -r, --rb-count=CNT           RingBuf max entries
  -s, --stacks                 Collect Kernel Launch Stacks
  -v, --verbose                Verbose debug output
  -?, --help                   Give this help list
   --usage                     Give a short usage message
   ```

 ```bash
./gpuevent_snoop  -p <pid> -a -s
